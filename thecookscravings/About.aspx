    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
                I’m a programmer who is dedicated on improving himself. I’m currently
                taking a postgraduate diploma in Information Technology program
                at Auckland Institute of Studies. I have completed a Bachelor’s in
                Science degree in Information Technology in the Philippines.

                When I was living in the Philippines, I have worked on web
                applications for managing events and managing project budget.
                I’m looking for a position that will help me grow my career as a developer.

                I have a student visa that allows me to work 20 hours per week and
                fulltime on holidays.
